# Ackley Function 
The ackely function data generator was created using the Julia programming language.

The data is generated for the hypercube with dimensions $x_i = [-20, 20]$, $i = 1:n$, where $n$ is the number of dimensions.

To run the file, in the command prompt, run 
```
$ julia AckleyFunction.jl
```
